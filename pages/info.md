## 50.001 Infosystems Project



## 50.002 Electronic Hardware Project

Each year, all Sophomore ISTD students are tasked to create their very own electronic game from scratch. Students only use FPGA to build their prototypes, with no other microcontrollers allowed. They are tasked to be as creative as possible to design their datapath around a single 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit, and come up with a fully functional  yet fun electronic game hardware. This project is the ultimate test for their fundamentals on the architecture of digital systems, emphasising structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. At the end of the project, students are able to explain the fundamentals of modern operating systems and appreciate the technical skills necessary to be a capable digital systems engineer.
