### Description

Simon’s Windows is based on the popular game Simon Says, but with a fun twist! Packed in a portable Gameboy-esque cardboard casing, Simon’s Windows (named after the 4 RGB LEDs) tests players’ memory and processing skills by changing things up with 2 differently-pitched buzzers.

Every level has a randomly-generated sequence of 8 LED flashes, with each being accompanied by either buzzer beeping. When the lower-pitched buzzer sounds, the appropriate button corresponding to the flashing LED should be pressed. However, when the higher-pitched buzzer sounds, the correct button to be pressed is the opposite one instead.

There is no time limit, so players can take their time to enter the correct answer, and get to as high a level as possible!
