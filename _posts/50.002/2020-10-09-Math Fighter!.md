### Description

Battle Math! is a street-fighter inspired multiplayer math/logic game, where you have to beat your opponent by answering the questions flashed in the central screen correctly! All you have to do is press the up/down buttons to get the number to fill in the blank that is displayed on the question screen, and hit “SUBMIT” before your opponent does. You win when your opponent’s health bar runs out and they K.O.!
