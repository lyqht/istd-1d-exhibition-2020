### Description

The climber is a 2-player fun, intuitive, and very competitive game. In Climber, players have to smash two buttons either green or red which depends on a randomly pre-generated but specific sequence to reach the top of the mountain, which consists of a series of 7 LEDs. The winner is the player who reaches the top of the mountain first and beats the opponent. This requires one to be quick and at the same time accurate with his/her button presses as if the player doesnâ€™t concentrate and presses the wrong buttons he/she has to start over the button smashing again.
