### Description

Rhy ♫ Pressed​ is a fun rhythm game inspired by many popular music games such as Osu!, Tap Tap Revenge and Audition Online.

This project is the culmination of our love for Music, Gaming and Computational Structures. Like most popular rhythm games, ​Rhy ♫ Pressed ​follows the same concept of button mashing fun while following various beats.

We have created our own version of this popular game concept through our project in the form of ​Rhy ♫ Pressed, ​our design is greatly inspired by retro arcade game controllers.

The frame of our game console is made of plywood with various engravings such as the game title and label.

On our design includes 3 LED buttons, a 32x8 cm LED strip for our main display. Attached to the surface of our frame also includes a 7-segment display for the game’s score, as well as 3 different coloured LED lights located on the top right to indicate the number of lives remaining.

All of these components are wired through the surface of our frame and connected to the FPGA beneath the frame of our console.
