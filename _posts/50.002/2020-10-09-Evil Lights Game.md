### Description

This project is called Evil Lights Game. It is a fun and easy to understand game to play with your family and friends. It is inspired by reaction-based games.

Tips: You need fast fingers and good brainpower to win!

Game modes:

There are 2 game modes: LED and Label. LED mode is simple: press the button that matches the colour of the LED that lights up. But Label mode is trickier: you have to press the colour of the button that matches the label on top of the LED that lights up. A 3-second timer indicated by the round number flashing will count down between each round before the LEDs light up. Each round a random combination will be chosen.

Earning points:

The player that is faster in pressing the correct button will earn a point. However, if the player reacts fast and presses the wrong button, the other player will get a point instead.

The player with the highest number of points at the end of 5 rounds will win the game!

Warning!! If you press more than 1 button at the same time, the other player will get the point!
