### Description

This project is inspired by the classic arcade game stacker. The goal of the game is to stack the blocks from the bottom to the top. At each level, the blocks will shift from one side to another horizontally. It will continue to do so until the player presses the stop button. The game will then check if the blocks are aligned (if there are any existing blocks beneath it). If there are no blocks beneath, the game will end and results in the player losing. Otherwise, the game will continue to the next level as blocks will appear on the next row and proceed to shift from side to side again. This continues until either the player loses or reach the top. If the blocks are stacked to the top, the player wins. Each level gets more difficult as the speed increases and the block length gets shorter. At any point in time during the game, the player can press the restart button to the reset the pattern and start over at the bottom.
