### Description

It was observed that a couple of students in secondary school struggle with interpreting comparison symbols correctly. This game is a gamified version of practicing interpreting numbers. Players are presented a screen with two sets of seven-segment displays (each set containing two seven-segment displays), showing two integer numbers ranging from -9 to 99 by random. Between the sets of seven-segment displays is an LED matrix, which shows four types of symbols: <, >, ≤ and ≥. There are also two sets of buttons for each player, each set containing two buttons with “T” (True) and “F” (False) labels on the buttons
