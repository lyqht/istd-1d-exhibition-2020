### Description

Inspired by the famous Lights Out game, Light Show is a timed puzzle game where a player has to find five unique patterns on a 4 x 4 board before the player’s health runs out. The player selects a light by selecting (x, y) buttons corresponding to the coordinates of the board. Selecting any of the lights on the board will flip the states of itself and its adjacent lights. At any point during the gameplay, the player can also select the level reset button to reset all the lights to “off”, but retain their current score. The total reset button restarts the game entirely.

The player has 125 seconds to complete the game, and the player’s current health is displayed by 5 blue LEDs, each representing 25 seconds. The player will know which patterns they have solved as there will be 5 red LEDs indicating the player’s score and the pattern they have found. Finding a pattern will light up the corresponding score LED, and each pattern can only be found once. Finding a pattern will also add one bonus health point (25 seconds) to the player, thus motivating the player to continue finding patterns.
