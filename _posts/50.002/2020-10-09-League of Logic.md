### Description

Our game encourages quick reflex thinking while building the playerâ€™s foundations in bitwise operations as well as conversion of decimal to binary numbers.

For every round of gameplay, players are presented with random questions where a logic gate and two decimal numbers are given. They will have to first convert both decimal numbers appearing in the question (0 to 7) to binary (3 bits), then deduce the outputs of the bitwise operation in binary. Finally, they will input their answer using the three switches provided (up for 1, down for 0) and hit the button in the center to submit their answer.

One point will be awarded to the first player who answers correctly. The question being displayed will be refreshed after 7 seconds if neither player has answered it correctly. The game will end when 5 rounds of questions have been answered.

THE CHAMPION OF LOGIC HAS EMERGED!!!!
