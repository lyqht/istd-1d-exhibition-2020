### Description

Yavalath is a game generated by the computer program LUDI in 2007, where players take turns placing pieces on a board, and the aim is to make a row of four without first making a row of three. As an AI-designed game, we felt that implementing it with logic gates would pay homage to the progression from simple roots of computing to high-level abstraction. We were faced with several challenges, primarily due to the dimensions of the board. Our board has 61 Hexagons, this posed a significant issue due to the large number of states which would be infeasible for an FSM. As such we embarked on the creation of our own 16-bit architecture based on the Beta CPU. This presented us with several constraints, both in terms of our instruction set and our memory (128 bytes), and also in our output format (using 27 wires to control 61 RGB LEDs).
