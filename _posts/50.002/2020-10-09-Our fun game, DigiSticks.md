### Description

This project is a variant of the two-player chopsticks hand game. Chopsticks is a hand game for two or more players, in which players extend a selected number of fingers from each hand and transfer those scores by taking turns to tap one hand against another. Chopsticks is an example of a combinatorial game and is solved in the sense that with perfect play, an optimal strategy from any point is known.

For our project, we digitized this hand game and initiated some reworking and remodelling of the whole design process. We utilize the variant with remainders and transfers, with an additional extension of including boolean operations into the game (instead of just additions and modulos).

Points in our game represent fingers in the actual game. This is a base 5 game, therefore there is a roll-over amount of 5 for each hand (when the hand reaches 5, goes back to 0 points), this is represented by only 4 points/fingers in our game.
