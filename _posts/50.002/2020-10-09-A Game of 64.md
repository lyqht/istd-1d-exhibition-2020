### Description

This game of 64 is a modified version of the popular 2048 mobile game. The gameboard consists of a 3x3 2-digit grid, 4 directional buttons, 1 reset button and the 7-segment LED of the FPGA used to display the number of moves the player has made. The player starts by pressing one of the directional buttons to randomly pick a grid to spawn the number ‘1’. The player must then merge numbers of equal value until they reach the number ‘64’. The player loses if the entire grid is filled (no zeroes) and there are no numbers of equal value that are adjacent to one another.
