### Description

Fire in the Mole is a unique take on the classic arcade game, Whac-A-Mole. The mole takes on two meanings in our game. You get a point when you push the button next to the green LED that lights up, similar to a traditional Whac-A-Mole game. However, there is also a red LED that might light up, acting as a “mole” (spy)! Be careful when the red LED lights up as you will lose the game. Other ways to lose include not pressing the correct button in time and pressing a button whose adjacent LED is completely unlit. The game gets progressively harder, where there is only 1 mole when the score is <10, 2 moles when <20 and 3 moles when the score is <30. The player wins when the score hits 30.
