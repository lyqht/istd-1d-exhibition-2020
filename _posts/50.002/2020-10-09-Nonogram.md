### Description

Inspired by the promise of a universal machine, our team set out to build a fully featured Instruction Set Architecture. The result is our Friendly Unpipelined Beta-16 (FUB16), which can run not just a single game – but any possible collection of games we can dream of, and really any program written in our Assembly.

Taking design cues from MIT’s Beta, we fine-tuned the instruction specifications for a 16-bit ALU, and we built in a dedicated VGA ROM and memory for video outputs. Joysticks and buttons serve as input devices, providing a nostalgic and satisfying user experience.

This allowed us to bring to life a modern classic: Nonogram. The numbers on the side of our 7x7 game space represent the number of continuous, filled-in squares. The player follows these numbers, steadily filling up the board, while a surprising image is steadily revealed.

We hope you enjoy this game, as a small teaser to the unlimited number of levels, games and programs that would be possible on our humble FUB16.
