### Description

The origin of the game Achi traces its roots back to Ghana, where it exists as a two-player abstract strategy game. It is similar in play-style to tic-tac-toe, but even more so to games like 3 men’s morris and Nine Holes as pieces change position as the game progresses, with the ultimate goal of creating a 3-in-a-row situation.

Our version of this game differs slightly from the official version of Achi in that while users still have four pieces to drop and the game is still split into two stages, users can now skip their turn once to obtain a more strategically advantageous playing board. Forfeiting of turns occurs when users wait out their time-limited turn either purposefully or accidentally. This implementation of a timer for each turn also simulates an environment similar to that of blitz chess, creating a more exciting game.

The rules of our version of the game are simple:

Aim: Like in Tic-tac-toe, the goal is to achieve a 3-in-a-row situation with your pieces ahead of the other player.

In Stage 1:

● Players are to take turns to palace their allocated 4 pieces. Once all 4 pieces are used up, the game will proceed to stage 2.

● Players are not allowed to skip their turn in stage 1.

● Depending on the difficulty, the amount of time to execute each turn is different with

lesser time in increasing difficulty levels(easy - No time, Intermediate - 8s, Advanced - 5s)

In stage 2:

● Players are to take turns to move their tiles that are adjacent to the one vacant tile.

● Players are allowed to strategically skip once per game.

● Missing their turns twice would result in losing the game.
