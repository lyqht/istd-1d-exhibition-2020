### Description

This is a double player arithmetic game that consists of basic mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The game consists of a 3-digit seven segment to display the question, a timer, and LEDs to show the score of each player. Players have a time limit of 9 seconds to answer each randomly generated question that is flashed to them on the 3-digit seven segment. Using the two buttons that represent ‘0’ and ‘1’, the players then have to key in the answer to the question in binary form. Player with the higher score at the end will be declared as the winner. This game can train the player’s speed and accuracy when it comes to converting from decimal to binary.
