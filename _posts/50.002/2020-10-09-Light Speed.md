### Description

Who has the fastest hand among your friends? Are you stressed with your projects or work recently? Play our Light Speed and relieve your stress. Light Speed is designed for 2 players inspired from classic Strike A Light arcade game. Our game consists of 17 buttons, 8 buttons for each player, and 1 button to start the game. Each game takes 30-seconds, and each player gets 1-point whenever they press a lit button. The buttons are randomly lit up. The faster the player presses the lit buttons, the higher score he/she can get. All buttons will light up at the winnerâ€™s side at the end of the game.
