### Description

D-Press is a one player survival game that tests your reaction and reflexes. The aim of the game is to catch the green pixel and to stay alive by avoiding the red pixel. The blue pixel (D-bug), can only move clockwise or anti-clockwise around the path, and changes its direction when the big blue button is pressed. Whenever the blue pixel meets a green pixel, the player gains a point reflected on the 7-segment display. The speed of the blue pixel would also increase as the player earns a point. The game ends immediately when the blue pixel and the red pixel collide.
