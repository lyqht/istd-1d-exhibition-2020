### Description

Don’t Go Over is a fun game for a group of 2-5 players. The goal of the game is to try and get other players to go over the target value while not getting caught out yourself. The meta is all about achieving a delicate balance between trying to sabotage your opponents and keeping yourself safe.

The game is based on a current value and a target value (which is hardcoded). Players sit around in a circle and pass the device around. The device has four buttons with randomly generated numbers. The player must choose one of these four buttons, which adds to the current value. The game ends when the current value exceeds the target value. The player that caused the value to exceed the target is “out”.
