### Description

Our arcade game, The Bomb Defuser, was made for partial fulfilment of the 50.002 - Computational Structures module. The goal of the game is for players to roll the ball into the specific holes on the game board, following a specific sequence provided. If the player manages to complete the sequence, the player wins. If the ball rolls into the wrong hole at any time, the BOMB will explode, and the player will lose.

Time is of the essence since players only have 99 seconds to complete the target sequence. If the timer hits 0 and the sequence is not completed, the BOMB will also explode! Players are challenged to keep calm while working under pressure. What is needed is a pair of steady hands and the patience to defuse the bomb.

Have fun and try to defuse the bomb to save the people around you!
