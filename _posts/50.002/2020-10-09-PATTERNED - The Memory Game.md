### Description

This project is a game that tests the memory and strategy of players. For a total of 9 levels, players have to memorise between 1 to 9 patterns in succession and then proceed to enter these patterns in succession once all of the patterns have been displayed. Once the player clears the ninth pattern of level 9, the player wins the game. However, if at any point the player fails to press the correct buttons in the allocated time given, the player will lose the game. The timer resets for every correct input for a pattern. The patterns are displayed using 9 LEDs arranged in a 3x3 grid, with an additional one LED to indicate that the LED pattern displayed on 3x3 grid has to be memorised or whether the latest set of buttons pressed matches the pattern.

The aim of the game is to allow players to improve their memory, develop strategies on how to memorise things quickly and efficiently as well as develop teamwork skills if the game is played with multiple players at once.
