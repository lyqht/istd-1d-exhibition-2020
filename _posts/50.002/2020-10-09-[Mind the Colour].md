### Description

This project is a short game featuring flashing LED colour sequences and pressing the matching coloured buttons. The LEDs are placed in the same square-shaped arrangement as the coloured buttons (one at each corner), and for the first difficulty level, the LEDs will light up distinctly and matching the buttons (if, say, the yellow-coloured button is at the top-right corner of the arrangement, the top-right LED will display a yellow light). This encourages the player to memorise the sequence of colour flashes. Should the player fail the sequence, the game will be stopped. This project was built using LEDs (including common-cathode RGB LEDs), 7-segment 4-digit displays, arcade and push-buttons, and an Alchitry Au FPGA.
