### Description

This project is about an obstacle course where players are provided a 6 by 8 LED matrix with lighted up LEDs representing obstacles to avoid. Player LED is lighted up with a different color at the bottom left of the matrix, and players can press the left and right buttons to avoid the obstacles that automatically come down.

Each map is 6 by 16 LEDs, and conquering each map earns the player 1 GPA point. Conquering all 5 maps will allow the player to win with a total of 5 GPA points.

The inspiration for this game comes from a RPG game called Ni no Kuni. It has a mini game where players are required to control two avatars to navigate through two different paths, thus testing the players’ coordination and concentration skills. Our initial game also required players to control two objects through a path, but due to the small screen size resulting from our limited budget, as well as several time constraints, we decided to have players control only one object instead. The difficulty is instead raised by having more obstacles and creating a maze-like map for players to navigate through, which also makes it challenging and fun.
