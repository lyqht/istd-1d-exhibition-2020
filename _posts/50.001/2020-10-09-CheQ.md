### Team Members

### Description

CheQ was created to allow restaurant goers the convenience of knowing how long they would have to queue to get into their restaurants of choice remotely, without having to travel to the physical location and finding a long queue waiting for them. CheQ displays queue waiting times for different groups sizes and the number of patrons in front of you in the queue. After deciding on a restaurant, users can join the queue and pre-order menu items via the application, saving them some time when the restaurant begins to prepare their meals as their turn to enter nears. Restaurants are able to upload their dishes and prices to CheQ for customers to view as well, enabling them to feature limited time only dishes which users can then view in their accounts.
