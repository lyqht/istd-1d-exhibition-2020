### Description

PLENT is your one stop school events app for students and organisers. Events are an integral part of maintaining the vibrant student life here in SUTD. They range from fifth row introductory sessions, performances, workshops and talks. However, filtering through these event advertisements on numerous platforms coupled with the repetitive signup process can be a pain. Organisers have more work cut out due to Covid-19 measures as well, such as keeping track of a participants capacity.

PLENT solves all of those problems for you. It condenses all event information in scrollable categories, so that students can easily browse and learn more about the upcoming events. Creating events are made easy by standardizing a �create events form� that only students with event organizer permissions (eg. EXCO members of fifth rows) are able to access and upload. Signing up for events is so much easier too, as your information (eg. name, student ID, email) will be stored during signup and will be automatically sent to the organizers when you just click the �SIGN UP� button. This serves as automatic collation of participants for the event organizers as well. If the student already signed up for an event that clashes with a new event they want to sign up for, they will be alerted to confirm their decision. Students are also able to keep track of all the events they have signed up for through a calendar view that compiles and colour-codes their events based on their categories (eg. Fifth Row, Industry Talks, Student Life).

CHOOSE PLENT - Plenty of events, none of the bullshit.
