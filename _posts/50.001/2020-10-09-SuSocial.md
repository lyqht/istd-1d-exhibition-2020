### Description

SUTD Social is a networking app specially made for the SUTD community. It allows students to search for peers who possess the skills they require for any projects, and also serves as an informative platform to establish professional relationships within the community. Facebook was also started to introduce connections within Harvard University, so why not our very own SUTD social networking app?

Looking to host an event but don't have the technical expertise? Have an idea for a project but don't have all the skills it would require? SUTD Social's matching algorithm can help you form your dream team by finding users who have the most relevant skills that you are searching for.

Bombarded with emails and wish there was a consolidated place to find all announcements from eDimension, Piazza, etc? Want to tell everyone about an exciting piece of industry news? SUTD Social's bulletin board not only allows you to make your own public posts, but various filters can also be used to refine your newsfeed as well however you like, such as into a purely course-related announcement feed!

SUTD Social! The One-Stop App for SUTD.
