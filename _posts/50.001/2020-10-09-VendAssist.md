### Description

VendAssist is an application that allows the user to access information of vending machines across campus at their fingertips, remotely, which is important in this current crisis to reduce outdoor exposure.

VendAssist allows the users to browse through the items offered by the vending machines on campus, the nutritional information of every product and displays their availability. Users can also easily locate the vending machines that contain their desired items through the map feature. The availability of the products is updated in real time to ensure that users will get accurate information whenever they access them. Users can then navigate to the respective vending machines rather than visiting various vending machines due to items being unavailable, bringing about convenience for users and helping to minimize crowd movement in the school.
