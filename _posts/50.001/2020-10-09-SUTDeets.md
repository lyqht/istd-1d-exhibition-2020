### Description

#### The Problem

This project was emanated by issues brought upon by

1. Immense number of events blasted weekly through school e-mails
2. Current subpar solutions with existing mobile applications

These issues are pertinent as poor event management not only shows the disorganisation of the school system, but would also give rise to secondary effects such as:

- Faculty and students missing out on important events, also resulting in them being less likely to participate in extra-curricular activities
- Guest speakers would be less willing to return to SUTD to host events
- Existing solutions are all browser-based across devices and operating systems; no mobile-friendly apps that understood UI/UX design principles

#### Our Solution

After the extreme thorough analysis of stakeholders needs and constraints, we decided to develop a user-friendly, concise and customisable event management app specially curated for the relevant stakeholders in mind.

#### Key Features

- Front-end:
  - Allows all to view events and relevant promotions ONLY if theyâ€™re involved/subscribed using...
  - Our customisable Tag System, one is able select their preferences, and are able to change it anytime, anywhere.
  - Design with detailed UI/UX such as user-friendly sidebar and concise event calendar
- Back-end:
  - All relevant data is stored in a dedicated firebase from user accounts, preferences and event details
  - Distinct user roles with its relevant permissions (Fifth Row EXCO able to create their own events, etc.)
