### Description

Take time, make time! This project introduces our Schedo app that helps to reduce stress and improve performance. Due to the lack of time management, students experience deadline pressure and have insufficient time to produce good quality work, thus contributing to the accumulation of stress in a vicious cycle. However, the Schedo app generates an efficient personal schedule for the users based on their own timetable and life pattern so that users no longer have to worry about insufficient time to finish their tasks or forgotten deadlines due to ineffective scheduling abilities.

How it works?

It is easy. Firstly, let the app know when you are free to do work on each day. Then, input assignments' due dates and estimated completion times. If your assignment is weekly recurring, simply toggle a switch and we will generate all the tasks for you. Lastly, the Schedo app will automatically generate a flexible schedule with breaks every 2 hours to ensure that you do not burn out.
