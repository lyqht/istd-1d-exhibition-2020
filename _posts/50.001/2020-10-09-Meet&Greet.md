### Description

For our 50.001 1D project, we made an app called Meet & Greet which is designed to be a platform for people to get notified and join events in SUTD. This is especially useful with the Covid-19 situation now whereby people rarely gather and meet others. This app allows an user to create a group event of any category, be it sports, gaming, studies. The group details a specific date, time, location and description and allows anyone using the app to view and join an event. We have designed the app such that it is easier for people to find the groups they are interested in through a search bar which can find groups with specific categories or names. We have also included additional features to make the app even more convenient and appealing to use. This includes the display of groups joined and bookmarked on the profile page for users to keep track of their groups more easily, syncing events joined with the smartphone calendar to serve as a reminder, and allowing the user to upload a picture for both the event and the user which makes the app even more vibrant and attractive to use.
