### Description

Community is one of the strongest motivators, and PUG is here to use its spirit to

encourage us to exercise! PUG's easy to use interface makes organising and joining activities simple. We seek to unite users who wish to have a platform to connect with like-minded individuals to play their favourite sports and exercise together.

PUG draws inspiration from the kampung spirit in Singapore, fostering a community that plays together. Organising and joining events is streamlined and can be done in the snap of a finger. You can view and sort the activities that you have signed up for, organised or previously participated by accessing them in one click from the home page. Other key features include filters to sort events by date, sport and location for when joining events as well as a customisable profile.
