### Description

SnapTrack is an NFC-based, all-encompassing, no-nonsense companion that empowers users to track their time effortlessly with a simple tap and make smarter time management choices.  In the new normal for students and working professionals alike, working from home is blurring the lines between work and leisure. Through our app, users can better compartmentalise their lives and re-find their balance by placing NFC tags in different physical locations. This creates a metaphysical separation which disjoints our workspaces from our rest spaces, allowing users to concentrate their efforts in hustling or resting with a clarity of mind. Additionally, with our intuitive data analytics and visualisation, users can easily review past time investments and make future time management goals. In the future, we hope to create goals and app restriction features to better encourage users to make time management plans.
