### Description

GoDutchLeh is a smartphone app that consolidates and optimises all your bill splitting needs. If you've ever gone out with friends for a day or two, you can benefit from our app! With it, you no longer need to worry about bill settling for the entirety of your group's time together. Say goodbye to awkward payment interruptions and `I-owe-him-but-he-owes-you-so-I-pay-you' calculations! Furthermore, our app takes money out of your relationships by acting as the`loan shark', sending reminders to your friends in case they forget to pay. GoDutchLeh also lets you keep a record of your events and individual bills for each event in case you ever want to backtrack your spending!
