### Description

With the rise of online learning, education and communication for students has changed drastically. Our app aims to improve the online learning environment through a shared and supportive communication platform with peers.

Our app allows students to create and join small group chat rooms, based on which subjects the student has selected. For example, I might create a `Studying Java Week 12' room, within the 50.001 Intro to Info Sys and Programming subject. My peers and friends would then be able to see and join that room, allowing us to discuss that particular topic.

Additional features include Google Calendar integration, helpful links to SUTD pages on the home page, a Profile page with a handy notepad to store notes/tasks, and a Friends page to view all users.
