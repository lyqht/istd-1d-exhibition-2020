### Description

We found that there is a lack of centralised area for lost and found items. The campus lost and found is primarily fulfilled by good Samaritans and passing on information through various common chat groups. We feel that this process can be improved on as the information may be buried in large common groups or the information may not reach the right person this way. Therefore, for our project we built a smartphone app that provides a centralised area for SUTD staff and students to report items that they have lost or found. In the app, you may view all active postings that other users have created. If you have found or lost an item, you may also create a posting, describing the item and if you so choose, upload an image of the item. The app allows you to communicate with other users of the app anonymously using an in-built chat so as to help to facilitate return of items.
