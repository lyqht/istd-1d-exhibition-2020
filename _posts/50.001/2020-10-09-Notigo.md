### Description

This is a smartphone app that provides a centralized place for students to see the most important updates. Our app intends to solve the problem of unnecessary navigation to many platforms. Due to COVID-19 Situation, there are a myriad of E-learning platforms for conveying important announcements, causing updates to be spammed. As a result, it is difficult for students to keep track of constant updates across many platforms. This causes them to miss out on crucial updates such as project due dates, exam information etc. We aim to solve this problem with our notigo app. By using firebase database, a centralised platform, which gets updated whenever there is a new event on various platforms such as Edimension, Piazza, Outlook. Students can view all the scheduled events from only one platform -the notigo app. They can click refresh to check for the latest updates that are pulled from firebase. When the task is completed, students can swipe to delete the event. The deletion will also be updated on firebase.
