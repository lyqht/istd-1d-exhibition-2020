### Description

Good finance planning includes keeping track of money inflow and outflow, but is often a difficult task to accomplish consistently. Our app hence aims to make this task a much easier one.

Very often, users have a list of items on multiple receipts, which is time-consuming to record down. However, with our text recognition app, users can easily snap a picture of their receipts, and the app will automatically compute the total amount spent. Users can then categorize it and add notes. Otherwise, users also have the option to manually key in the transaction.

These transaction details will be reflected on the income/expense page, and the net amount will be displayed at the top of the dashboard page. A pie chart is also available below to allow the user to see at a glance the categories they have spent on as well as the proportion relative to one another, enabling them to better track their financial activities.

These features aim to make finance tracking a much more convenient, quick and intuitive task to do on a daily basis, encouraging users to keep up the habit in the long run.
