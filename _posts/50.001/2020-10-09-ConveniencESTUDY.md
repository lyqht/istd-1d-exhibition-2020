### Description

Given the situation of COVID-19, both students and instructors might not be accustomed to online platforms designed for teaching and learning purposes. They might have various functions and are a bit complicated, imposing troubles on both stakeholders. Thus, our solution is a one stop app where teachers are able to easily set up quizzes or tests, mark homework and provide relevant feedback based on students' performance.

Users firstly have to sign up in this app according to their identity eg. instructors or students. Corresponding data will be saved to the database when their registrations are successful. As an instructor, the main page will be showing a set-up quiz function, whereas as a student, he/she will only be able to take the quiz and wait for instructor's feedback once it's commented. The instructor may also feel free to delete the quiz that they had made for students when it was no longer used. After finishing the quiz, students can also check their scores on the top left corner. It is designed to have least efforts from both sides to use the app so as to enhance their online using experience.
