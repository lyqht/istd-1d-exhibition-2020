### Description

Problem

80% of young adults aged 15 to 25 years old spend more than 1 day to decide the venue of their next outing. Whenever someone proposes a meetup, it is always painstakingly difficult to find a timing when everyone is available, even more so to collectively agree on where to go. We particularly feel this problem when we notice our close friends grudgingly agree to our next outing venue with obscured disappointment and dismay. But, what if we can make happier outings for everyone? This is why we created Meetup Mouse!

Meetup Mouse

Meetup Mouse is a mobile app that recommends the best outing location for you and your friends. It will first understand you and your friends' dietary preferences, then suggest 20 locations that are central to all your locations and satisfy your dietary preferences. After you and your friends have selected your favorite locations from the 20 locations, Meetup Mouse presents you with the location which is the best for everyone!
