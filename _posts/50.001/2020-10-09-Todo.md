### Description

If you have felt swamped and disorganised, scrambling to organise your due assignments, Todo is here for you.

Todo is a compact to-do list app, modified to cater to the needs of SUTD students. Todo enables you to add tasks quickly with a few taps, plan around your modules, due dates, and even due times. It also contains an importance level feature, enabling you to keep track of your most urgent tasks coming up, as well as look at your lined-up assignments on a calendar overview page. Todo works with our database of existing SUTD modules to help you keep work for each module separate and neat, allowing you to customise the modules you want, chosen from an in-built list.

Todo keeps you going, with unique inspirational quotes greeting you whenever you start up the app, and it shows you your progress for the week to push you ever closer to that 100%.  When you have cleared a task, simply swipe to let Todo know and it will clear your task for you.

Productivity. Time management. Focus. We'll help you Todo better.
