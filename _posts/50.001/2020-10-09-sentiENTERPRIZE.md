### Description

Are you an SME looking to cut costs on ERP (enterprise resource planning)? Look no further! sentiENTERPRIZE is a mobile app that integrates POS system with automated inventory management. This compact yet powerful app does away the unnecessary complexities involved in resource planning, and lets you focus on your business needs and strategies. It intends to replace the overpriced existing ERP systems that the majority of SMEs cannot afford. sentiENTERPRIZE offers three main features: point of sales, inventory management, and profile statistics. Point of sales allows you to delve deep into your sales history and track transaction details. Inventory management offers a bird's eye view of your current inventory, in which you can easily add, edit or remove entries. You can also post live comments within each entry, which allows for cross-department colleagues to quickly communicate if any issues were to occur. In addition, you can also star your customers' favourite items under the "Favourite" tab. Last but not least, profile statistics provides a quick summary of your business performance of late. Did we also mention that all the data is retrieved in real-time? Everything gets updated in a blink of an eye. With sentiENTERPRIZE, you can now focus on what truly matters  -  growing your business.
