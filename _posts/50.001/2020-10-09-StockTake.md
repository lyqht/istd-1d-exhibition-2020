### Description

StockTake is an inventory management app aimed to help student organizations manage their inventory. Currently, the management of inventory is done by maintaining a spreadsheet or worse, none at all. This app seeks to improve this process by providing convenient access to the list of inventory items, as well as an efficient way to loan items from clubs. Initially, students set up their app account by logging in using their Google account. During the signup process, students must enter their club membership details and tie in their student ID cards to their account. Once done, they are able to add inventory items to their clubs. They can also view the items of other clubs that they may wish to loan out. To loan out an item, the potential loanee contacts the admin of the club they wish to borrow from through Telegram. Upon agreement, both parties meet up to where the item is stored. The owner of the item scans the QR code attached to the item and enters the quantity and expected loan end date. The owner is then prompted to scan the student ID card of the loanee. Subsequently, both parties can keep track of their loan history. This enables student organizations to oversee their inventory items with accountability in mind.
