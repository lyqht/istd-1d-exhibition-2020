### Description

Our project is a smartphone app that serves as a publicity platform for the SUTD community.

Currently, Email is the go-to platform for publicizing events. Because of this, there is a risk of too many "spam" mails from events students are not interested in which may also lead to more important emails becoming inaccessible due to the influx of numerous emails. Our goal is to provide a personalized browsing experience so that you never have to miss an opportunity.

The app aims to make it easier to access information on events users are actually interested in by giving the ability to "follow" opportunities of their interest. Since the interface is similar to social media apps like Instagram, you can browse through posts on events with more ease and convenience compared to slowly opening your emails.

As an event organiser, our app allows you to post about you or your Fifth Row's upcoming activities, advertising it to the student population who can then view the post to learn more about the event and sign-up from the signup links (if provided).
