### Description

s(NO)oze is an android alarm app that aims to wake users up without snoozing their alarms.

Currently, many people rely on the default alarm systems of their smartphones to wake up.

However, these built-in systems have a deadly weapon - the snooze button.

The snooze button causes 2 main detriments to the user:

oo    Firstly, snoozing often causes people to oversleep past their scheduled alarm.

oo    Secondly, snoozing can also bring about reduced cognitive and sensory-motor abilities as `sleep inertia', where  the body faces repeated interruptions to their REM sleep without fully waking up.

Our app intends to create a smoother and more engaging waking experience, so that the user will only have to wake up once without falling back asleep.

Upon facing our app's alarm, instead of the usual snooze button, users will instead be faced with a simple game that they must complete before they can turn off the alarm.

We hope to engage user's senses and mental powers to ensure that they are fully awake, and are less likely to go back to sleep.

We have also added an account-based system for users to log in and keep track of their alarm usage.
