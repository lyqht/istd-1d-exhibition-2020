### Description

Beever is a Project Management App that lets you communicate easily, assign tasks to group members, and keep track of events from your project groups - all in one place. Simply create an account with us, and you're ready to go! Upon logging in to the app, you will be brought to the dashboard, where you can view your upcoming events and have quick access to your favourite groups. You can create a group under the "Groups" tab, which enables a chat function for easy communication between group members. It also gives you access to the "Gap Finder", the main feature of our app where we will scan through each member's calendars to find a common time slot for group meetings - all you have to do is input your preferred date, time, and meeting duration and let the Gap Finder do its work! We also have a calendar function that allows you to add and display both group events and individual events, and a to-do function that allows you to create and assign tasks to group members and monitor deadlines closely. All in all, Beever is a handy tool to add to your toolbox and guarantees you a better project experience. â˜º
